# django_local_library
Tutorial "Local Library" website written in Django.

----

This web application creates an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.

The main features that have currently been implemented are:

* There are models for books, book copies, genre, language and authors.
* Users can view list and detail information for books and authors.
* Admin users can create and manage models. The admin has been optimised (the basic registration is present in admin.py, but commented out).
* Librarians can renew reserved books
